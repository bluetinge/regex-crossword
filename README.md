===============

Implementation of a RegExp crossword.

This fork takes the autogenerated RegExp puzzles by [Joosep](https://github.com/joosep/regex-crossword/) and [binoternary](https://github.com/binoternary/regex-crossword-generator), and updates their formatting such that they are compatible with the latest RegExp crossword viewer by [Jimbly](https://github.com/Jimbly/regex-crossword/).

View the puzzles added by this fork at [https://bluetinge.github.io/regex-crossword/](https://bluetinge.github.io/regex-crossword/), and the original viewer at [http://jimbly.github.io/regex-crossword/](http://jimbly.github.io/regex-crossword/).
